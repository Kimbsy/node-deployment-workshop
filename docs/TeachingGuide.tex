\section{Introduction to Node - What is it?}

Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. One such application could be a socket based reactive chat application. In this deployment session we will aim to build and deploy a Node.js based web application using Socket.IO on top of the brilliant \href{http://koding.com}{koding.com} hosting environment. With the skills gained from this workshop you should be equipped to go out to build and deploy your own reactive web applications on a hosted environment such as Koding or in Cloud environments such as DigitalOcean or locally on your own Raspberry Pi!

\section {Getting the source}

All content explained in this workshop is contained in an easily deployable repository online. This can be accessed at:\\
\\
{\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/thomasmortensson/node-deployment-workshop}\\
\end{center}
}

You can browse through this repository at your own leisure if you wish to go back over things we have covered in the workshop or just wish to have a simple base application to start with. Using the instructions in the README.md file you should be able to easily deploy this application on \href{http://koding.com}{koding.com} or in a \href{http://digitalocean.com}{DigitalOcean} droplet.

\section{Deployment}

The Koding system uses an operating system called ubuntu which is similar to that of the Raspberry Pi. All of the commands supplied below are compatible with the raspbian distribution bundled on the Raspberry Pi. 

\subsection{ubuntu and apt-get}

To install packages within ubuntu or debian 

\subsection{Node and npm}

\subsection{Bower}

\section{Installation under Windows - Not recommended}
